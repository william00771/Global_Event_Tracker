## Timeline

1-2 days of planning. 5 days of coding. 

## A solution that bundles all types of events into an interactive map.

So Imagine this. Say you enjoy salsa during the evening, or basketball during the day, or maybe you are going to barcelona next week and want to see what's happening over there before you go on your trip. 

That's the idea behind this app. An curated selection of events personalized for you. Whether you're into concerts, workshops or food festivals. This app brings these things to your fingertips.
So no more sifting through endless listings or missing out on events.
